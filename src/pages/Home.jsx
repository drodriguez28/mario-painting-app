          {" "}
          In the year 1998 , Mario Rodriguez immigrated to the United States
          with his wife to seek a better opportunities and a better future.
          Immigrating to the U.S with 10 cents in his pocket, he began to search
          for a job and started working for a painting company in metro Atlanta.
          Around the time of the great recession in the US, Mario was let go
          from his job due to the financial crisis. At the time he had to
          provide his two kids and wife, and starting job hunting around
          especially in the painting industry. Two months later a woman named
          Cathy Petretti, presented a idea for him to become a freelancer. Cathy
          started to spread the word to teachers around the school (where she
          worked at) if anyone needed some painting work done at their home.
          Soon enough Mario got calls and started working as a freelancer and
          created the company Mario's Painting of Roswell.
